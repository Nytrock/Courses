# Courses
This repository contains every course I've ever taken. All courses are divided into thematic groups and in each group they are distributed from the oldest to the newest. Thematic groups are arranged depending on the importance of the topic for me. Starting from a certain point, I also began to maintain repositories with solutions to problems for each of the courses. Links to them are attached to the corresponding courses.

P.S. There are no courses from GeekBrains because it's cringe.
